# STEM103_Level3_1-ForLoop

For this assignment, I used the for loop to make a counter to keep track of values and implementing an incremental to those values. I used it to keep track of the total number of space mission and the total number of successful missions. Also, I used the for loop to print out the names of the missions that correlated to the year when it was launched.
